# About <a name = "about"></a>

This bot will reply to posts on your subreddit with a message that you set, at an interval you set as well.




# Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites <a name = "prereq"></a>

This project is built with Node.JS. Download the latest version [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Now download the code from this repo and use `npm i` to install the dependencies required to develop and run your bot.


## Setting Up Your Script App <a name = "script_app"></a>

You'll have to create a new account for your bot before you move any further.\
Once the account is created, log in, go to [reddit.com/prefs/apps](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps) to fill out the form to create a new script app.

## Environment Variables <a name = "env_var"></a>
-----

Now that you've set up your bot account and created a script app, it's time to download the source code and paste in your environment variables.\
Also have open reddit.com/prefs/apps as you'll need to copy & paste the items you'll find there.

<br>

__USER_AGENT__ is just a name that the server will identify your bot by. It can be whatever you want.\
__CLIENT_ID__ and __CLIENT_SECRET__ are fround in prefs/apps.\
__REDDIT_USER__ is your bots username.\
__REDDIT_PASS__ is its password.\
__MASTER_SUB__ is the subreddit the SubMonitor Service will work on.\
__DEBUG_CODE__ and __DEBUG_NETWORK__ should be set to false unless any problems arise.\
__STARTUP_LIMIT__ will cause the bot to check this many items on the first sweep. Setting this value higher will ensure that when stopping and restarting the bot, no requests are forgotten. This value may be set up to 100\
__SUBMISSION_LIMIT__ Will limit the amount of tasks the __SubMonitorBot Service__ and __MultiSubMonitor Service__ will generate on each sweep after the first. On very active subs with many submissions per minute, this option may be set up to 100.\
__INTERVAL__ The time (in seconds) which the bot should sleep between doing its job again. Easily changed to minutes for production by simply multiplying the value by 60 before pushing out your code.
